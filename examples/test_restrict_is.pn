// This test just tests that we can write `x is nat` instead of `x are nat`
Restrict x is nat.

test() := exists x. !finite_num(x)
#assert_prop(false, test)

#forget(x)

// This is the same as the above, except that x is no longer restricted to nat
test2() := exists x. !finite_num(x)
#assert_prop(true, test2)
