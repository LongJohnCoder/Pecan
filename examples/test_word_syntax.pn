// This file is to test that usign the "word" version of connectives works (e.g., "if P then Q" instead of "P => Q")

Restrict x, y, z are nat.

test() := forall x. forall y. x < y <=> (exists z. x + z = y & z > 0)
#assert_prop(true, test)

test2() := forall x. if x is even then (x + 1) is odd else (x + 1) is even
#assert_prop(true, test2)
