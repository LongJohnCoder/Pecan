Restrict i,j,k,n,m,p are binary.

// The nth digit of the Thue-Morse Word, T, is 1 iff n in binary has an odd number of ones
$T(n) := odd_ones(n)

period(i,j,p) :=
    p > 0 &
    i is binary & j is binary & p is binary &
    forall k.
        if i <= k & k < j - p then $T[k] = $T[k+p]

Theorem ("For every p > 0, the Thue-Morse word has a factor with least period p.", {
    forall p. if p > 0 then exists i,j. p = min { m : period(i,j,m) }
}).
